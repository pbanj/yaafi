Just a bare bones adb installer/updater I made for personal use. It's just a bat file that uses dload to pull the newest adb from google, then it pulls the bare min for adb and fastboot to work out of the zip and tosses them in the windows folder so they work from anywhere without needing to add to path.
will always work as long as google doesnt change their url structure.



How to use:  
Download the zip from the repository and extract the folder somewhere.  
Then just run the bat as admin and follow the on screen instructions.




As for licensing, I dont care if you credit me or not as the bat file is extremely simple
